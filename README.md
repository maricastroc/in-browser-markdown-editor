## üìö Project Description

In this project, I developed a fully-functional in-browser markdown editor application with a light/dark mode toggle. The application includes the following features.

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete markdown documents
- Name and save documents to be accessed as needed
- Edit the markdown of a document and see the formatted preview of the content
- View a full-page preview of the formatted content
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed


## üìå What did I learn?

This project provided an excellent opportunity to utilize the react-markdown library for converting markdown texts into HTML code. Additionally, I gained experience in data storage using localStorage and organizing CRUD operations within a context, which facilitated communication between components. To enhance user experience, I implemented toasts to provide feedback after saving and deleting a document.

The project also presented CSS challenges in designing various layouts based on different screen sizes. To overcome these challenges, I leveraged componentization, utilized styled-components, and followed a mobile-first approach, which greatly assisted in resolving these issues.
